# File generated from our OpenAPI spec by Scalar. See README.md for details.

# Shared by every smoke test under `tests/`. Each test calls one SDK method the way the SDK
# exposes it, against the server named by TEST_API_BASE_URL:
#
#   TEST_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4010 python -m pytest
#
# Environment variables:
#   - TEST_API_BASE_URL: the server to call. Unset, every smoke test skips, so a plain `pytest`
#     never calls the real API. Credentials come from the variables the client itself reads.
#   - SCALAR_SMOKE_FILTER: comma-separated needles; only cases whose operation name or path
#     contains one of them run. Empty means no filter.
#   - SCALAR_SMOKE_REPORT_DIR: a directory; each test process appends one JSON line per case it
#     ran to its own file there. The generator uses this to collect per-case results.
#
# Regeneration does not yet delete a test module whose resource was renamed or removed. Delete a
# stale module under `tests/api_resources/` by hand, or `pytest` keeps running it.
